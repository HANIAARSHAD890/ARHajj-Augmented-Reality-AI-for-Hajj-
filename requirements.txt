Objective:
Create a web application using your best-trained ML model, make predictions from it, and pass the prediction result to a chatbot that uses Gemini API for further querying. Also, create a poster summarizing your project.

Steps to Complete:
1. Choose Your Best Model
Evaluate your models and select the one with the highest accuracy.

Save it using joblib or pickle.

2. Build the Web App
You can use one of the following:

Streamlit (easiest for ML apps)

Flask (more flexible but more code)

HTML/CSS with Flask backend

The app should:

Take input from the user.

Use the trained model to make predictions.
Show the result on the screen.

3. Integrate Gemini API
After showing the prediction, send it as a query to the Gemini chatbot via their API.

Display the response from the Gemini API under the prediction.

The Gemini API documentation link should have:

How to get a free API key.

Sample code to use Gemini for query completion.

If you need help understanding the API documentation, share the link here.

4. Make a Poster
Include in the poster:

Project title

Dataset used

Model accuracy

Web app screenshots

How Gemini API was integrated

Output examples

Optional Tech Stack Suggestion:
Model: Trained in Python (e.g., scikit-learn)

Web App: Streamlit (fast deployment) or Flask

API Call: requests or httpx in Python to connect to Gemini

Poster: Canva / PowerPoint / Figma

If you want, I can help you:

Set up a Streamlit/Flask template

Generate code to call Gemini API
